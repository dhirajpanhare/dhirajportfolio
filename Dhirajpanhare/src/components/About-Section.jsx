        <p>
    I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate with a Diploma and B-Tech from Acropolis Institute of Technology and Research. Despite my engineering background, my true passion lies in software engineering. I am deeply interested in the world of coding, software development, and technology, and I am actively working to transition into this field.

            My journey into software engineering began with my participation in hackathons, such as WittyHacks 3.0, which helped me hone my problem-solving abilities and fuel my interest in coding. Currently, I am focusing on strengthening my skills in C/C++, C#, .NET, and Full Stack Development.
            
            As a software enthusiast, I am committed to continuous learning and development, working on real-world projects, and keeping up-to-date with the latest technologies. My goal is to apply my technical expertise and passion for software engineering to contribute meaningfully in the industry.
            
            I am currently seeking opportunities to leverage my growing skill set in full-stack development, and I am eager to work with teams that value innovation, creativity, and problem-solving
